# Data_mining

The following Algorithms of Data Mining are implemented using Pyhton Spark (pySpark). The data here is very big with millions of rows in the files.

HW1: How Apache Spark Works, apache spark transformations and actions with RDD.

HW2: SON Algorithm: The SON algorithm impart itself well to a parallel â€“ computing environment. 

HW3: 

  Part-1
  
    implement Min-Hash and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to find similar businesses efficiently. 
    
  Part-2
  
    Recommended System (Context Based Recommended System as well as Collaborative Filtering Recommended System)
    
HW4: K-Means as well as BFR Algorithms.
